    "# Harry Potter Stretches His Legs\n",
    "A [scathing review](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-sep-19-oe-bloom19-story.html) of Harry Potter and Stephen King by Harold Bloom has given rise to a popular copy pasted [meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/5rissv/harry_potter_plebeian_pasta/), in which the following is claimed:\n",
    "\n",
    ">I went to the Yale bookstore and bought and read a copy of “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.” I suffered a great deal in the process. The writing was dreadful; the book was terrible. As I read, I noticed that every time a character went for a walk, **the author wrote instead that the character “stretched his legs.”** I began marking on the back of an envelope every time that phrase was repeated. I stopped only after I had marked the envelope **several dozen times.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, Harold Bloom misquotes his earlier [review](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB963270836801555352) - he had not counted dozen of occurences of the phrase \"stretches his legs\", but of cliches akin to it. Regardless, let's investigate this claim: how many times does the sentence really appear in the Harry Potter books?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading Harry Potter\n",
    "Let's not inflect more pain on Harold Bloom and let Python handle the reading. We legally purchased the books as .epub files, which where uncompressed into folders containing xhtml files for each chapters. We can read the content of the books by parsing these xhtml files. We look for the 'p' tag, split the text roughly by sentences with period delimiters, and replace a few formatting characters."
